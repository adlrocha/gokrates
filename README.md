# GOKRATES
*Disclaimer: Unfinished work. It started as a Proof of Concept in my spare time, but the rapid development of Zokrates have made this code obsolete and I have trouble keeping it up to date. You are welcome to contribute.*

Go wrapper for Zokrates. If we can use ZKSnarks in Solidity, why not using them also in Go?
Use this library to play with ZKSnarks in Go.
* Be sure that you have Docker installed and your $GOPATH appropriately defined.
